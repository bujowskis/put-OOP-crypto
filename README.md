Repository for Object-Oriented Programming C++ project - a cryptocurrency wallet

## Compiling and running
`main.cpp` is, as the name suggests, the main entry point of the project. `all_headers.h` combines all the necessary
headers needed for the whole project to work. As long as the structure given in this repo is preserved, compiling it
can be done with a simple
```
g++ -o main main.cpp
```
provided you're using g++ compiler.

The program doesn't take any command-line arguments. If it requires a user input, the instructions should be enough to
understand it.
